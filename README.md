# Jumpstarter

Jumpstarter is my own version of a crowdfunding platform where people can raise money from the general public for their business, product, or any other project they want to raise money for while also providing a platform for people to contribute to these projects that they might be passionate about. This application shares a lot of the same features that exist in some of the more popular crowdfunding platforms out there like being able to create a campaign, contribute money towards one, comment on a campaign, search for campaigns, etc. I also tried to mimic some stylistic features that exist in other crowdfunding platforms while also adding my own personal touch.
